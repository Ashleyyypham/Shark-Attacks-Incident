# Shark-Attacks-Incident

My First Tableau Dashboard – Shark Incidents in Australia 🎄

I’m currently learning Tableau, and I’m excited to share my very first dashboard!
This project explores how shark incidents impact different areas of Australia through interactive visualizations and insights.
🧭 Overview Stats

    Total incidents: 371

    Fatalities: 94

    Average incidents per year: 3.2

    Average fatalities per year: 0.8

📍 Geographic Insights

    New South Wales (NSW) has the highest number of incidents (155).

    South Australia (SA) shows the highest fatality rate.

    Incidents are most concentrated along Australia's east coast.

🕒 Time & Season Trends

    Shark attacks peak during summer and autumn (November to April).

    The data can be divided into three timeline "cycles":

        Early years: Low incident numbers due to fewer ocean activities and limited records.

        Mid-20th century: A spike in fatal and injury incidents.

        Recent years: More incidents overall, but many are non-injury thanks to better safety, medical care, and reporting.

🦈 Shark Species Involved

    Most common in attacks: White Shark, Tiger Shark, Wobbegong

    Most fatal species:

        White Shark – 70 fatal cases

        Tiger Shark – 40

        Bull Shark – 35

👤 Victim Demographics

    Males make up 90% of reported incidents.

    Most affected age group: 31–45 years, followed by under-18s.

    Many cases have unknown age data due to missing records.

🚨 Incident Severity

    Most common injuries:

        Major lacerations – 151

        Minor lacerations – 130

    Fatal injuries: Only 2 recorded in this dataset.

    Unprovoked incidents are much more frequent (80) than provoked ones (14).

    Most affected body parts: Legs and arms, then torso and head.

🌊 Where Do Attacks Happen?

    Coastal areas are the most common (329 incidents).

    Fewer incidents in the open ocean, estuaries, or harbors.

🏄 Activity-Related Risks

    Most high-risk activities:

        Boarding (180 cases)

        Swimming (93)

    Other activities include diving, spearfishing, and boating.

🧠 Final Takeaways

    Shark attacks in Australia are rare but increasing, mainly due to more people engaging in coastal activities.

    Prevention efforts should focus on:

        Public awareness in summer

        Activity-specific safety

        Regional monitoring—especially in NSW and QLD

    The White, Tiger, and Bull Sharks are the key species to consider in safety strategies.
